 * Investigate in pydoc, source code documentation extractor

 * Adopt helper scripts for including src/const and using const.progname
   or const.techname instead of literals. For this to work move dummy
   definition of _() from setup.py to its own module file.

 * More sensible detection of data directories (data, l18n, ...) in setup
   script (low priority)

 * Deos extraction of translateable strings from glade file work? (Yes, but
   does translation of the glade ui during run-time work?)

 * UnitTests, pyLint, Profiler, et al.

 * Add info pane where all supported keyboard models can be seen and which
   model understands which registration data (FINISH 3RD TAB PAGE)

 * UPDATE MANUAL

 * Show exception output in a popup window ???

 * Respond to ascii-exception UnicodeEncodeError (Umlauts). Maybe filter them
   out or so ...
