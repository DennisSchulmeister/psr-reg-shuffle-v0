 * Investigate in pydoc, source code documentation extractor

 * Adopt helper scripts for including src/const and using const.progname
   or const.techname instead of literals. For this to work move dummy
   definition of _() from setup.py to its own module file.

 * More sensible detection of data directories (data, l18n, ...) in setup
   script (low priority)

 * UnitTests, pyLint, Profiler, et al.

 * Show exception output in a popup window ???

 * Respond to ascii-exception UnicodeEncodeError (Umlauts). Maybe filter them
   out or so ...

 * On doc/man/make.py CLEAN remove build/, too. Otherwise it belongs to the
   super-user once the programs gets installed system-wide.

 * Print set list tab (V 0.3)

 * Batch processor to not split registrations which go together. (V 0.3)

 * Make sure credits can be translated. (partially done, needs retranslation)
