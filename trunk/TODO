 * Investigate in pydoc, source code documentation extractor

 * Adopt helper scripts for including src/const and using const.progname
   or const.techname instead of literals. For this to work move dummy
   definition of _() from setup.py to its own module file.

 * More sensible detection of data directories (data, l18n, ...) in setup
   script (low priority)

 * Deos extraction of translateable strings from glade file work?

 * UnitTests, pyLint, Profiler, et al.
