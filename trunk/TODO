 * Investigate in pydoc, source code documentation extractor

 * Adopt helper scripts for including src/const and using const.progname
   or const.techname instead of literals. For this to work move dummy
   definition of _() from setup.py to its own module file.

 * More sensible detection of data directories (data, l18n, ...) in setup
   script (low priority)

 * Flesh out classes for accessing bank files, registrations and registration
   files. Think about sensible tests.

 * Make GUI work and make it use the fleshed out access classes.
    * During mainwindow.__init__(...) insert directory chooser widget and
      insert about text.

 * Fix bug of Kiwi preventing automatic creation of man files
