 * Investigate in pydoc, source code documentation extractor

 * More sensible detection of data directories (data, l18n, ...) in setup
   script (low priority)

 * UnitTests, pyLint, Profiler, et al.

 * On doc/man/make.py CLEAN remove build/, too. Otherwise it belongs to the
   super-user once the programs gets installed system-wide.

 * Make sure credits can be translated. (partially done, needs retranslation) (V 0.3)

 * Respond to ascii-exception UnicodeEncodeError (Umlauts). Maybe filter them
   out or so ...

   OR FIX: Replace ascii converter (reg names) with better match. (At least
   on Tyros) (V 0.3 ??)

 * Fix new bug: Creation of man pages doesn't work because help2man command
   cannot retrieve --help information ???

 * Nice manual (far beyond man page) with lots of pictures (after V 0.3)
