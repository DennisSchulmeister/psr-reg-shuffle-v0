 * Investigate in pydoc, source code documentation extractor

 * Adopt helper scripts for including src/const and using const.progname
   or const.techname instead of literals. For this to work move dummy
   definition of _() from setup.py to its own module file.

 * More sensible detection of data directories (data, l18n, ...) in setup
   script (low priority)

 * Deos extraction of translateable strings from glade file work?

 * Flesh out classes for accessing bank files, registrations and registration
   files. Think about sensible tests.

 * Make GUI work and make it use the fleshed out access classes.

 * Refactor regbank.registration.Registration.getClassForKeyboardName:
    * Global function classSearcher
    * Takes class object whose sub-classes are explored
    * Takes a lambda hash function which hashes one test subject (Keyboard name,
      registration file) into a string of the keyboard make
    * Takes a lambda test function which calls a found classes's test
      function
    * Uses the hash value for speedy dictionaly lookup. Performs deep class
      search only if no class found from dictionary.

 * Introduce __all__ to all modules and packages.
