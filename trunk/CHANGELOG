 * Changed URL to http://www.psrregshuffle.de
 * Reengineered class finder algorithm to work with system-wide installed
   version, too and to be easier to understand.


2008-07-17  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Equiped all modules with global __all__ list which contains all publicly
   exported symbol names.
 * Refactored algorithm for finding subclasses of RegBank and Registrations.
   Now contained in ClassFinder which also makes use of caching.
 * Implmented sub-class lookup for classes RegBank and Registration.
 * Renamed modules named "exceptions" due to naming conflict with Python's
   standard library.
 * Merged module regbank.models with const.
 * Created and implemented BankFile_PSR2000 class for accessing registration
   banks of the Yamaha PSR-2000 keyboard.
 * Created and implemented Registration_PSR2000 class for accessing and
   manipulating registration data of the Yamaha PSR-2000 keyboard.
 * Implemented RegFile class for storing single registrations to disc.
 * Importing registrations now works.
 * New class EasyDragAndDrop to simplify drag and drop implementation for
   "new registration bank" panel.
 * Implemented complete panel "New Registrtion Bank". Thus the application
   has reached it's full planed feature set.


2008-07-16  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Wrote script for quick running of all available tests.
 * Defined API for bank files. (Class regbank.bankfile.BankFile)
 * Defined API for editing registrations (Class regbank.registration.Registration)
 * Defined API for registration files (Class regfile.regfile.RegFile)
 * Introduced constants for keyboard models (regbank.models)
 * Introduced main window class.
 * Introduced classes for coordinating the import of registrations and the
   assembly of bank files. For this certain signals from the main window are
   delegated to the coordinator objects.
 * Introduced exception sub-modules for packages regfile and regbank.
 * Made modules export public members (__all__).
 * Sketched out algorithm for automatically determining apropriate subclass
   of Registration according to a given keyboard model.


2008-07-12  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Established sub-packages called tests to hold unit tests.


2008-07-09  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Extended helper scripts by additional command line option --clean (or -c)
   which removes previously generated files.
 * Extended setup script to use the newly introduced cleanup services in order
   remove files generated with root permissions. Those files could break the
   helper scripts otherwise as they weren't allowed to overwrite the files
   when re-run with user-privileges.
 * Extended setup script to assume "--help" option if no option is given
   by the user. Otherwise the call to setup(...) would not return and there
   would be no chance to clean up afterwards.


2008-07-08  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Made setup script output the licence name if requested by --licence.


2008-07-07  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Wrote a python script which uses xgettext for extracting all
   translateable strings from the source and glade files.
 * Wrote a python script which uses msgfmt for building binary catalog
   files from available translations.
 * Extended setup.py to install localized message catalogs.
 * Cleaned up subversion repository from unwanted files (like *.pyc and so on).


2008-07-07  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Created project directories and empty modules
 * Created modules const and main as well as class Main. The program can
   already display --help and --version strings.
 * Created startup scripts for installed and local source versions
 * Created setup script (distutils)
 * Created man page build script
 * Created english man page


2008-07-06  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Start of development
 * Analysis of bank file format
 * Design of the user-interface using glade
