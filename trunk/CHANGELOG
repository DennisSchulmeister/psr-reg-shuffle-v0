2008-09-29  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Fixed bug which prevented man page creation by catching the insulting
   exception and by changing the English man page's locale from generic "en"
   to valid "en_US".


2008-09-28  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Fixed bug of missing translations under MS Windows.
 * While at it made helper scripts use program name and version definitions
   of const module instead of literals. (Finaly)
 * Maybe introduced a new bug: Creation of man pages doesn't work anymore.


2008-09-25  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Completly reimplemented batch processing algorithm. Now it is possible
   to prevent splitting of registrations with common suffix.


2008-08-30  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Added exception hook which shows uncatched exceptions in a dialog.


2008-08-29  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Finished setlist export and printing.


2008-08-25  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Object-oriented redesign of export algorithm. (No printing yet)
 * stripName method for all ModelSpecific sub-classes. Strips file extionsions
   and other non-name data (like icons) from name strings.


2008-08-24  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Added support for YAMAHA PSR-S700.
 * Refactored MainWindow class. Tab-classes do now create their widgets
   on their own. The MainWindow object doesn't hold a reference to the tab's
   widgets anymore.
 * Splited credits string so that translation works.
 * Implemented paragmatic prevention of renaming a dummy entry (### EMPTY ###)
   for import tab.
 * Implemented "Quick Rename" tab.
 * Partialy implemented "Print setlist" tab.
 * Prepared batch dialog for grouping registrations which go together.


2008-08-21  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Pragmatic fix for missing button images in Windows version. (overriding
   the default behaviour of the gtkrc file because the user most probably
   wouldn't want to deal with that.)
 * TAG: Version 0.2
 * Marked PSR-2000 description as translatable. (Thanks Claudio for letting
   me know.)


2008-08-20  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Updated documentation including first version of the README file and the
   man page.

2008-08-19  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Finished batch processing.
 * Fixed bug: Wrong length byte of Yamaha Tyros style registrations. Length
   bytes don't include the registration header.
 * Changed behaviour of import page. List of known file extension gets
   derived from BankFile classes now.
 * Removed unnecessary check which disallows changing the data
   directory to itself.
 * Fixed minor bugs with missing filter updates and checking allowed buttons
   in create bank page for certain scenarios.
 * Improoved description of Yamaha Tyros style registration banks for
   better language-style.
 * Pragmatic bug fix: Since there seems no easy way to disallow editing of
   single ObjectList lines, changes to dummy registrations (### EMPTY ###) will
   now be undone after editing.


2008-08-18  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Finished display filter for available registrations.


2008-08-17  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Extended UI by display filter selection and batch button.
 * Moved keybiard information from ModelSpecific class to BankFile. Added
   default file extension.
 * The save dialog (bank files) now gives a hint about the needed file
   extension. (In form of a wild-card like *.reg or *.rgt)
 * Intrdocued AboutTab class in order to shrink MainWindow class a bit.
 * The "Keyboard Information" tab now shows some technical data derived from
   the BankFile classes, too.
 * Moved all message texts to const.msg for enhancing reusability.
 * Added clear button for import list
 * Added smart disabling of invalid buttons (for extended user guidance)


2008-08-16  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Introduced a common base-class for all exceptions of all packages.
 * Extended bankfile.ModelSpecific by user documentation
 * New classmethod bankfile.ModelSpecific.getAllSubclasses. Uses a re-modeled
   ClassFinder which now returns a list instead of one value.
 * Using the new getAllSubclasses method in order to build the keyboard list
   for new registration out of actually existing classes instead of a
   pre-definied list.
 * Extended pre-defined list of keyboard models in turn.
 * Added descriptive information about supported keyboard models and finished
   the keyboard information page to display them.


2008-08-15  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Revamped UI layout. Instead of aligning buttons bellow lists they now
   reside next to the list they belong to. The window now always opens
   maximized. In total this makes for a more aesthetical and consistent look.
 * When opening a registration bank for import the status message now
   contains the file name instead of a generic success message.
 * Version 0.2 now comes with acknowledgements on the "About" pane.
 * File dialogs now change the processe's working directory when resolved.
   Because the directory won't be used otherwise in the program this makes the
   dialogs remember their last directory position.
 * Button images now get added by program code and using gtk.Button.set_
   image(). This makes sure that the image will always be displayed correctly
   and it will respect the user's settings about showing or hiding images from
   buttons. Unfortunately Glade 3 doesn't support this function, yet.



2008-08-14  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Fixed problem with missing method ObjectList.enable_dnd in older versios
   of the kiwi library. (e.g. kiwi 1.9.16 as available on Ubuntu 7.10)
   Added a "Add selected" button as an alternative to Drag'n'Drop.
 * "Save Registration Bank" button now checks for a valid keyboard model first.
 * Finished experimental support for Yamaha Tyros 1, Yamaha Tyros 2,
   Yamaha S900 and Yamaha PSR-3000 which all share a very similar file format.
 * Minor UI tweaks


2008-08-11  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Refactored classes regbank.Bankfile and regbank.Registration to be
   derived by a common super-class called regbank.ModelSpecific. This class
   holds all methods needed for searching classes by keyboard name.
 * Finished re-engineering of keyboard model support. If a regbank.bankfile.
   BankFile sub-class now supports more than one keyboard model the
   registrations of all models can be mixed. If this is unwanted sub-classes
   need to be created for each keyboard model.


2008-08-10  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Forcing the user to decide in advance which kind of registration she
   wants to create. Needed because file formats for Yamaha Tyros 1 & 2
   seem to differ in file header only. It also helps to prevent a bug when
   the user starts with adding more ##EMPTY## registrations as a certain
   keyboard model understands. She could still add at least one regular
   registration.
 * Re-engineered bankfile and registration class search to allow for
   more than one keyboard model to be supported by a class.
 * The import list now shows ### EMPTY ### for blank registrations just like
   the export list.


2008-08-07  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Fixed bug: Renaming an available registration now works again.
 * Changed behaviour of renaming: Renaming a registration from the list of
   available registrations (left) now changes the name of the exported
   registration if the name of the exported registration hasn't been changed
   before.


2008-08-06  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Changed URL to http://www.psrregshuffle.de
 * Reengineered class finder algorithm to work with system-wide installed
   version, too and to be easier to understand.


2008-07-17  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Equiped all modules with global __all__ list which contains all publicly
   exported symbol names.
 * Refactored algorithm for finding subclasses of RegBank and Registrations.
   Now contained in ClassFinder which also makes use of caching.
 * Implemented sub-class lookup for classes RegBank and Registration.
 * Renamed modules named "exceptions" due to naming conflict with Python's
   standard library.
 * Merged module regbank.models with const.
 * Created and implemented BankFile_PSR2000 class for accessing registration
   banks of the Yamaha PSR-2000 keyboard.
 * Created and implemented Registration_PSR2000 class for accessing and
   manipulating registration data of the Yamaha PSR-2000 keyboard.
 * Implemented RegFile class for storing single registrations to disc.
 * Importing registrations now works.
 * New class EasyDragAndDrop to simplify drag and drop implementation for
   "new registration bank" panel.
 * Implemented complete panel "New Registrtion Bank". Thus the application
   has reached it's full planed feature set.


2008-07-16  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Wrote script for quick running of all available tests.
 * Defined API for bank files. (Class regbank.bankfile.BankFile)
 * Defined API for editing registrations (Class regbank.registration.Registration)
 * Defined API for registration files (Class regfile.regfile.RegFile)
 * Introduced constants for keyboard models (regbank.models)
 * Introduced main window class.
 * Introduced classes for coordinating the import of registrations and the
   assembly of bank files. For this certain signals from the main window are
   delegated to the coordinator objects.
 * Introduced exception sub-modules for packages regfile and regbank.
 * Made modules export public members (__all__).
 * Sketched out algorithm for automatically determining apropriate subclass
   of Registration according to a given keyboard model.


2008-07-12  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Established sub-packages called tests to hold unit tests.


2008-07-09  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Extended helper scripts by additional command line option --clean (or -c)
   which removes previously generated files.
 * Extended setup script to use the newly introduced cleanup services in order
   remove files generated with root permissions. Those files could break the
   helper scripts otherwise as they weren't allowed to overwrite the files
   when re-run with user-privileges.
 * Extended setup script to assume "--help" option if no option is given
   by the user. Otherwise the call to setup(...) would not return and there
   would be no chance to clean up afterwards.


2008-07-08  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Made setup script output the licence name if requested by --licence.


2008-07-07  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Wrote a python script which uses xgettext for extracting all
   translateable strings from the source and glade files.
 * Wrote a python script which uses msgfmt for building binary catalog
   files from available translations.
 * Extended setup.py to install localized message catalogs.
 * Cleaned up subversion repository from unwanted files (like *.pyc and so on).


2008-07-07  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Created project directories and empty modules
 * Created modules const and main as well as class Main. The program can
   already display --help and --version strings.
 * Created startup scripts for installed and local source versions
 * Created setup script (distutils)
 * Created man page build script
 * Created english man page


2008-07-06  Dennis Schulmeister  <dennis -at- ncc-1701a.homelinux.net>

 * Start of development
 * Analysis of bank file format
 * Design of the user-interface using glade
