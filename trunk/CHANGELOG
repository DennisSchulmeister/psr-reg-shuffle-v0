 * Wrote script for quick running of all available tests.
 * Defined API for bank files. (Class regbank.bankfile.BankFile)
 * Defined API for editing registrations (Class regbank.registration.Registration)
 * Defined API for registration files (Class regfile.regfile.RegFile)
 * Introduced constants for keyboard models (regbank.models)
 * Introduced main window class.
 * Introduced classes for coordinating the import of registrations and the
   assembly of bank files. For this certain signals from the main window are
   delegated to the coordinator objects.

 * Established sub-packages called tests to hold unit tests.

 * Extended helper scripts by additional command line option --clean (or -c)
   which removes previously generated files.
 * Extended setup script to use the newly introduced cleanup services in order
   remove files generated with root permissions. Those files could break the
   helper scripts otherwise as they weren't allowed to overwrite the files
   when re-run with user-privileges.
 * Extended setup script to assume "--help" option if no option is given
   by the user. Otherwise the call to setup(...) would not return and there
   would be no chance to clean up afterwards.

 * Made setup script output the licence name if requested by --licence.
