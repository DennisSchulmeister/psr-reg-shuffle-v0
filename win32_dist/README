Building a ready-to-run Windows distribution of »PSR Registrations Shuffler« is
straight forward once you got all packages together. It's basically just a
regular python distribution with all python modules pre-installed. Note, that
this doesn't include GTK+ which needs to be installed separately by the user.

On a Windows machine perform the following steps:

 1. Make a clean install of python somewhere like D:\PYTHON25\.

 2. Copy python25.dll from C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32 into the program directory.

 3. Install all needed python modules there:

     * pyGTK 2.12.1
     * pyGObject 2.14.1-1
     * pyCairo 1.4.12.1
     * kiwi 1.9.22

     Later version should probably work, too.[*]

 4. Use distutils from the program's source tree in order to build a setup file
    for Windows:

    \> python setup.py bdist --format=wininst

    The exe-file will be in .\dist\ !!

 5. Use the installer to install psr-reg-shuffle into your python directory.

 6. Clean up by removing unnecessary documentation and test file from the python
    directory. This way you can shrink from ~ 89 Meg to 20 Meg.

 7. If necessary remove .svn directories from complete directory hierarchy.
    (e.g.: for dir in `ls -R`; do rm $dir/.svn; done; )

 8. Rename pythons README and LICENCE to python-README and python-LICENCE

 9. Copy psrregshuffle.bat into the top-directory. (See python25-template)

10. Rename the python directory to: psr-reg-shuffle_A.B_winXY_python where as
    A.B is the program version and XY the windows version like win32 or win64.

11. Use your favorite packager for building a neat ZIP-file.

That's all there is to do. But of course you should also test-run your newly
created distribution. Especially since the Windows versions of the employed
python modules might contain bugs of their own.

________________________

[*] ATTENTION: Don't use pyGTK 2.12.1-2. It actually lacks the following
method used by the »PSR Registration Shuffler«.

 --> gtk.gdk.DragContext.get_source_widget()

The pre-built Windows version simply doesn't include it. Unfortunately the
program won't run without. So either stick to pGTK 2.12.1-1 or any later
version. But anyway, make sure to test your distribution.
