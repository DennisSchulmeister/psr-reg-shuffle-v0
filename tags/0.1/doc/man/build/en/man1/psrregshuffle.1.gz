.SH PURPOSE
If you're using your PSR keyboard for live gigs you're most probably employing
its registration banks for storing each song's panel settings. After some time
you might grow quite a large set of registration banks this way. While creating
those is quite straight-forward organization is quite time consuming. Especially
if you have your banks organized according to your set list.

In most cases a song's settings don't change (much) between gigs. But the set
list might change. And than you're spending quite some time with assembling new
registration banks out of your existing banks. What makes the process so time
consuming is the fact that you always have to store your new bank to disc in
order to load another one which holds the settings for the next song. Than
you need to load the new bank again for storing the song in it. And so on.

The PSR Registration Shuffler is meant to set an abrupt end to this. You will
still need to create your registrations on the keyboard. And you need to apply
changes to them on the keyboard, too. But when you're preparing for an
upcoming gig and need to assemble new bank files out of pre-existing
registrations only you can do so within the comfort of your computer at a
speed unmatched by the keyboard.
.SH "HOW IT WORKS"
PSR Registration Shuffler maintains a data directory where you need to import
your bank files to. During that process the bank file gets split up into single
registrations so that the data directory contains many singular files with
each holding a registration. In that regard the data directory resembles a
library with all available registrations.

Afterwards you can assemble new bank files of all registrations. This means
the application will create ready-to-use bank files which you can transfer
to your keyboard. Note that the act of transfer is out of scope for PSR
Registration Shuffler. Depending on your keyboard model you can use a floppy
disc, an USB storage device or some other kind of connection.

As an added bonus you can set the name of each registration on the computer,
too. So you don't have to do so on the keyboard which also can take quite a
lot of time if the instrument doesn't allow to hook up an external keyboard.
But please keep in mind that this is the only supported manipulation of
registrations. Since the file format is poorly documented and widely
unknown to the public there are no other changes allowed. You should do them
on the instrument, anyway since on the computer you can't listen to your
changes.
.SH "ABOUT THE USER-INTERFACE"
The user-interface mainly consists of three tabs:

.br
\h'3' \(bu Create bank files
.br
\h'3' \(bu Import registrations
.br
\h'3' \(bu About

Yet above all tabs there is the data directory chooser. Use it in order to
select the data directory where you want to import your registrations to and
where you want to draw them from for assembling registration banks.

The first tab is where you can see all available registrations of the data
directory and build new banks. Therefor two lists are shown side by side. In
order to create a new bank just drag and drop the registrations from the left
list to the right one and push "Save bank file". You'll be asked for a filename
for the new bank file then.

In order to populate your data directory you need to import registrations
from existing bank files. This is what the second tab is for. Please make sure
to highlight (select) all registrations which you want to import. Not-selected
registrations won't be imported.

The third tab finally shows credits and copyright information.
.SH "KNOWN BUGS"
As I don't own any other PSR keyboard except the PSR-2000 and since the file
formats used by those keyboards are not well documented if at all the PSR-2000
is the only supported keyboard. If you own any other keyboard and are willing
to provide help of whatever type please get in touch with me.
