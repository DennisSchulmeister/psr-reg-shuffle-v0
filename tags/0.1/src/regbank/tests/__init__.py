PURPOSE
=======

This package contains all regression / unit tests of the regbank package.

USAGE
=====

The names of all test modules and all test classes need to start with a
test_ prefix. Otherwise the global run_test_suites script won't recognize
them. Tests must use the unittest module of python's standard library.

Tested modules can be best accessed via relative imports like
from .. import main
